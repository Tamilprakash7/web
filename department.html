The department has the constructive and valuable guidance of the management, ECE department has been making an all round progress. The ECE department has well experienced & qualified Faculties and eleven well equipped and furnished laboratories. We are accredited by ISO, NBA, NAAC and AICTE.</p>
<p>&#10003;  To motivate the Graduates to be successful in the professional practice of engineering or other related fields. They will obtain employment appropriate to their background, interests, and education and will advance in their career field.

 Graduates will engage in life-long learning; e.g., advanced education/degrees, professional development activities, and/or other career-appropriate options.

 Graduates who are employed within engineering fields will demonstrate technical competence, such as identifying, formulating, analyzing, and creating engineering solutions using appropriate current engineering techniques, skills, and tools.

 As appropriate to their professional or educational positions, graduates will

 Effectively communicate technical information in multiple formats,

<h2>CSE</h2>
<img src="cse1.jpeg"><p>&#10003; The Department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in the year 1993 with Under Graduate programme BE in Computer Science and Engineering. The Post Graduate Programme ME – Computer Science and Engineering was started in the year 2003. The current intake students are 120 for UG Programme and 18 for PG Programme. Both UG and PG Programmes are conducted based on the syllabus prescribed by the Anna University, Chennai. The department is equipped with well qualified and experienced faculty members to improve and enhance the knowledge of the student community. The department has good computing facilities with latest and updated versions of the software. The department conduct periodic workshop, seminar and conferences to help students, research scholars and industries to share a common platform and thereby strengthen the industry institution fusion.

</p><p>&#10003;  The department has an agreement with "TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION, FORECASTING AND ASSESSMENT COUNCIL (TIFAC), New Delhi for establishing a 'TIFAC-CENTRE OF RELEVANCE & EXCELLENCE FOR ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS under technology Vision – 2020 Mission on up gradation of Science and Engineering Colleges.
 <h2>CHEMICAL</h2>
<img src="chemical.jpeg">
<P>&#10003;  Bachelor of Technology in Chemical Engineering was started during 1998. It has good infrastructural facilities which include fluid mechanics lab, heat transfer and mass transfer labs, Chemical analysis lab, Reaction engineering lab, mechanical operations lab. It was also developed for the purpose of mechanical and bio technology departments. It also helps to pursue our students to undergo PG Programme in other branches for its future like bio-chemical, food technology, polymer technology, plastic technology, process design etc.


</p><p>&#10003; The staffs and student ratio is 1:8. The department has highly qualified faculty with a blend of academic experience. The faculty helps the students to present papers in different Seminars, Symposium and also encourage the students for these activities. They also try to get registered for Ph.D and carry out the R & D activities.

 Events

 The department has a chemical engineering association called Active Chemical Technologists Association (ACTA) which conducts student level seminars and lectures by eminent persons from various institutions and industries. It also conducts national level symposiums. Our students are also active members of Indian Institute of Chemical engineers association (IICHE) and Indian Institute of Technical Education (IE)

 Achievements

 </p><p>&#10003; Department have given 100% percent results in the university examination. Students have also achieved university ranks. Many of our students have been placed in reputed industries like Reliance refineries and wipro and also gone for higher education by clearing GATE & TOFEL.</P></LI>
